My material consists of three videos of Rick Astley's popular song "Never Gonna Give You Up," which can be found in the following locations: 

1. At York University crossroads/intersection in the Quad (near Aroma Espresso Bar, face North-West if you are at Aroma Expresso Bar)
2. In front of the Vari Hall (if you are in the Vari Hall, face East, the open space with a fountain at YorkU)
3. Jack Evelyn Wiggins park (face North-West if you are in Jack Evenlyn Wiggins Park)

Rotation: The rotation is dynamic in the sense that it always faces the viewer/camera. This is done to ensure that the video is presented correctly even if the viewer attempts to move behind/avobe/below the video. However, the initial rotation should be x:0 y:180 z:0 so that it stands upright.

Scale: The video's dimensions are 32 width and 24 height, with an x:0.85 y:0.85 z:0.85 scale. After some testing and walking around in real life, I came up with these parameters, which were neither too small nor too big.

When I was getting the requirements.txt through pipreqs which only shows the used/required packages, but it showed me no requirements in the venv and it ran perfectly, so instead I just did the pip freeze which includes all my packages in the venv

Imagine getting Rick-Rolled in AR ;)
