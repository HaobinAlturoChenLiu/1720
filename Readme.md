# PART A:
Our project consists of having multiple AR objects scattered around York University with some historical or meaningful information about that place. This goes back to the knowledge acquired in Quiz3, so this project is basically a location based AR. For my Lab 4 I will be contributing to my Phase 3 or Group 17 project. I will be making arrows that points towards each place that has an object so it allows the users to be able to follow the arrow and discover another of our AR objects in York. This should make it easier and more fun for users to discovers new places around York as they won't be wandering around without a sense of direction and where to go next. Aside from the arrows, I will be doing some of the assets and probably most of the implementation to the code and testing it. This involves finding locations and test them in real life to make sure they are presentable as well as creating different markers.
